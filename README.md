# To-Do List

This is a simple to-do list application built throughout the "Elixir in Action" book.

The problem is, admittedly, not spectacular, but itâ€™s complex enough to have something to work with while not being overly complicated.

To-Do List is a fully working distributed web server that can manage a large number of to-do lists.

## Features

- Creating a new to-do list
- Adding new entries to the list
- Updating existing entries in the list
- Deleting existing entries from the list
- Querying the list
